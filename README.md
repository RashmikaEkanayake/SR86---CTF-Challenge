# SR86---CTF-Challenge
This CTF program is developed in order to increase the practical knowledge of the players who are interested in information security-based tools and technologies.
In the CTF, the main scenario is based on an investigation scenario of an aircraft hijacking situation. The players will have to go through various types of practical information security forensic based levels in order to retrieve the flags required in the CTF levels.
